T4WeatherReport [ArrayList, loop, operators]

    Create a program that will define an ArrayList of recent temperatures. There is always extreme temperatures so to get a better reading of the data remove the highest 2 and lowest 2 temperatures. Then give the following information based on the temperature:

        max temperature, min temperature, median (middle temperature), mean (average temperature)

        also, give a prediction temperature range for the next  few days by using the average and both adding and subtracting 5 to create the range. The values for this predication can be whole numbers

        we can assume the data will always be an odd number so there will be one median

    Ex:
        input:
            62.1, 68.9, 55.4, 44.8, 77.3, 43.0, 53.4, 47.1, 55.8, 42.3, 48.5

            // excluded:  42.3, 43.0, 68.9, 77.3
            // data sample: 44.8, 47.1, 48.5, 53.4, 55.4, 55.8, 62.1

        output:
            max: 62.1
            min: 44.8
            median: 53.4
            mean: 52.44
            predication: 47 - 57
