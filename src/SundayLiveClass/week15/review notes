Collection Framework

    group of interface and classes which define and implement different algorithms for working with data. These collections are data structures that will store, remove, and get data in different ways

    data structure
        array: sized fixed, no methods, allows primitive and non primitive types
        Collections: more flexible, have different ways to handle data, only works with object types has methods

    The collection framework is created with inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism

Main interface of the framework

    Collection: the parent of the Collection types. Defines the main functions of a collection
        ex: add, remove, size

    List: ordered(index), allows duplicates

    Set: unordered(no indexes), does not allow duplicates

    Queue: typically FIFO (First In First Out) order
        * not always FIFO, depends on the class implementing

        Deque: an interface that allows access to elements from the beginning or end
    child of the Queue interface

    We will highlight the Map & Iterable interfaces separately

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q: What is the different between Collection and Collections

        Collection: the main/parent interface in the Collection Framework

        Collections: a utility class that has some useful methods for collection types
            sort, max, frequency

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    What is the advantage of the collection framework

        the different data structures have different implementations of algorithms to solve the problems of working with data

            Ex: add()
                defined in Collection interface
                abstract

                ArrayList: add element to to the end of internal array
                LinkedList: create a new node and the tail will have the reference of the new node

        performance:
            because a certain data structure focuses on one idea it will be able to perform that idea(functionality) efficiently

            adding, removing, searching

        *** Even though there is many collections types, often developers and testers need to only use List or Map types

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    What is the benefit of the Polymorphic reference

        references, especially the interface reference allows an object to be flexibly used in methods, constructors, data structures

            new ArrayList<>(Collection c) -> any object that implements the Collection interface can be given as the argument

            public static void m(List<Integer> nums){}
            public static List<Integer> m(){}

            addAll(Collection c)

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thread & Synchronization

        process: execution instance of a program

        thread: a sequence of execution within process

        synchronization: multiple threads cannot access at the same time
            - also known as thread-safe
            - if multiple threads did try to access a synchronized field they would need to access one at a time

        advantage: thread-safe
        disadvantage: slower

        Ex: multiple people accessing ATM

__________________________________________________________________

Classes that implement List:

    ArrayList: data structure that uses arrays internally. Re-sizeable array
        useful to storing and reading information

    LinkedList: data structure that uses nodes internally.
        also implements Deque -> doubly linked

        useful to manipulate the collection. adding or removing is handled efficiently

        Node: an object that has the value, reference to the node before it and reference to node after it

    Vector: legacy version of ArrayList. it is synchronized

        Stack: sub class of Vector. Notes below
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Classes that implement Set:

    HashSet: follows a Hashing algorithm, which means handles data fast and efficiently
        data structure that uses HashMap internally (talk about this later)

        the order is basically random

    LinkedHashSet(): data structure that uses HashTable and LinkedList implementations
        the insertion order is maintained

    -> Interface: SortedSet extends Set

    TreeSet: implements the SortedSet
        Elements are stored in the natural order(sorted order, smallest to largest, lexicographical)
        null is not allowed

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stack vs Queue

Stack
    sub class of Vector

    LIFO: Last In First Out
        ex: stack of books

    push(): adding the element to the top of the stack. also returns the element added
    pop(): removing the element at the top of the stack. also returns that element removed
    peek(): returns the element at the top of the stack

Queue

    Queue is an interface inheriting the Collection interface

    FIFO: First In First Out
        ex: a line of people

        add() <--> offer()
        remove() <--> poll()
        element() <--> peek()

        The methods on the left can cause an exception to occur whenever the method fails
        The method on the right just return null

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Classes that implement Queue

    PriorityQueue: data structure that stores elements based on its own priority. Sometimes looks like natural order, but cannot be predicted (random)

        does not accept null

    Note: Even though Queue is the interface the PriorityQueue has its own implementation of the idea

    ArrayDeque: implementing Deque. More proper queue type
        also has access to both side of the collection

        does not accept null
__________________________________________________________________

Iterable

    interface
    parent of the Collection interface

    any data structure that implements the Iterable, which is any data structure that implements Collection interface, can be iterated with a for each loop

    The interface defined this abstract method:

        Iterator<T> iterator();

        this abstract method was implemented in the collection classes. The methods returns an iterator object which allows us to iterate through the elements one at a time using the methods of the iterator. It iterates through from beginning to end

        -> think of the iterator as a pin
        -> when the iterator method is called the start point is BEFORE the first element

    methods:

        hasNext(): returns boolean. checks if there is any element next to the current position of the iterator(pin)

        next(): returns the element. first moves the iterator to the next element and it returns that element

        remove(): remove the element at the current iterator position

____________________________________________________________

Map

    interface that does NOT inherit the Collection interface

    Map is still part of the java collection framework

    the main idea of this interface is the key / value format

        Entry: key / pair

        each key is linked to some value

        -> keys must be unique
        -> values can be duplicate

Syntax:

    Map < keyDatatype, valueDatatype > referenceName = object

    Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();

Classes that implement the Map interface

    HashMap: order the entries is not guaranteed (random order)

        using hashing algorithm (fast and efficient)

    LinkedHashMap: insertion order of the entries is maintained

    TreeMap:
        implements SortedMap (interface)

        The entries are sorted in a natural order(based on the keys)
            -> ascending order, smallest to biggest, lexicographical

        null key is not allowed

    HashTable: the order is not guaranteed (random order)
        legacy class -> inheriting Dictionary
        synchronized (thread - safe)
        both null keys and values not allowed

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Methods:

    put(key, value):
        takes the key and value and stores that entry into the map

        -> if the key already exists the value will be updated(reassigned) because the key must be unique

    get(key):
        returns the value that is linked to the given key

        -> what if the key does not exist? it returns null

    remove(key)
        uses the key to determine which entry to remove

    containsKey(key)
        returns boolean based on if the map has that key defined

    containsValue(value)
        returns boolean based on if the map has the value defined

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looping through a Map:

    can we use for each loop directly with the map
        no, it does not implement Iterable

        Map<String, Double> map = new HashMap<>();

        for(type : map) <- just this does not work

    keySet(): returns a Set of keys

        then we can iterate through the keys and use those to read the value

        for(String key : map.keySet()){}

    values(): returns all the values of the map

        for(String value : map.values()){}

    entrySet(): returns all the entries of map

        for(Map.Entry<String, Double> entry : map.entrySet()){}

        methods to access information from the entry:
            getkey()
            getValue()
